## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create a model that predicts whether a vehicle requires maintenance. The process includes data exploration, preprocessing, and training various classification algorithms to achieve accurate predictions. 

Key steps in the project include:
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Encoding and Normalization
4. Visualization of Key Metrics
5. Model Training and Evaluation

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and imbalanced-learn.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset and explore its structure.
2. Preprocess the data by cleaning and encoding categorical variables.
3. Normalize numerical features to ensure consistent scaling.
4. Create visualizations to analyze trends and relationships within the data.
5. Train and evaluate multiple classification models to predict maintenance needs.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of various features related to vehicle characteristics and history, including:

- **Mileage**: The total distance the vehicle has traveled.
- **Odometer Reading**: Current reading from the vehicle's odometer.
- **Tire Condition**: Status of the vehicle's tires.
- **Brake Condition**: Status of the vehicle's brakes.
- **Owner Type**: Type of ownership (e.g., individual, company).
- **Maintenance History**: Past maintenance records.

The target variable is `Need_Maintenance`, indicating whether the vehicle requires maintenance.

## Data Processing

Data processing involves several steps:
- Cleaning the dataset to remove irrelevant features.
- Encoding categorical variables to numeric formats for model compatibility.
- Normalizing numerical features to bring them to a common scale.

## Visualizations

Visualizations are created to help understand the data better. Key visualizations include:
- Count of vehicles needing maintenance.
- Histograms showing the distribution of mileage and odometer readings.
- Count plots to compare maintenance needs across different fuel types and maintenance history.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Various classification algorithms are employed to predict vehicle maintenance needs. Models may include:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness.

## Results

The results section summarizes the model performance and includes a discussion of the most significant features influencing maintenance needs. It also highlights the importance of predictive maintenance in enhancing vehicle safety and reducing unexpected breakdowns.
